# RadarRainfallMosaic-TH

An Open-Source Framework for Mosaic Radar-Based Rainfall Estimation Across Thailand's Watersheds.

- These python-based codes were developed for mosaicking radar rainfall data from 12 stations operated by the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD).
- The proposed mosaic framework is based on open-source radar and geoinformatics libraries.
- Heavy rainfall caused by Tropical Storm Son-tihn in 2018 has been used as a case study to demonstrate the proposed framework.
- paper titled "An open-source framework for mosaic radar-based rainfall estimation across Thailand's watersheds" publised in spatial information research see in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41324-025-00606-3 and can be freely read from https://rdcu.be/d8jRX

## Getting Started

```powershell
winget install --id Anaconda.Miniconda3

# open anaconda powershell prompt
cd [clone path]
conda env create -f env_mossf_cappi.yml
```

## TODO
1. add how to get data 
    1.`../1data/0radar/1Mosaic_hourly_1hour_sotntihn/` 
    2. `./0variables_cappi/cappi_hourly_times.txt`
