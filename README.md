# RadarRainfallMosaic-TH
An Open-Source Framework for Mosaic Radar-Based Rainfall Estimation Across Thailand's Watersheds.

- These python-based codes were developed for mosaicking radar rainfall data from 12 stations operated by the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD).
- The proposed mosaic framework is based on open-source radar and geoinformatics libraries.
- Heavy rainfall caused by Tropical Storm Son-tihn in 2018 has been used as a case study to demonstrate the proposed framework.
